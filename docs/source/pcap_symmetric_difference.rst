Pcap Symmetric Difference
=========================
Symmetric Difference is included for sake of set operation completeness.

Example
-------
Given sets A = (1, 2, 3), B = (2, 3, 4), C = (3, 4, 5), A△B△C = (1, 5)

    For all pcaps, the symmetric difference produces a pcap that has the
    packets that are unique to only that pcap (unlike above where only one
    set is the result).
