Timebounded Intersection
========================

Explanation
-----------
Create a packet capture intersection out of two files using ip.ids.

    Let 2 packet captures have the following packets and assume that traffic
    originates behind the device that Pcap1 is capturing on:

    Pcap1                           Pcap2
    A                               W
    B                               X
    C                               A
    D                               B
    E                               F
    F                               M
    G                               C
    H                               G
    I                               L

    The algorithm would have found that packet A is the earliest common packet
    and that G is the latest common packet. The returned pcaps would like so:

    Pcap1                           Pcap2
    A                               A
    B                               B
    C                               F
    D                               M
    E                               C
    F                               G
    G

    NOTES
        * In Pcap2, M does not exist in Pcap1
        * In Pcap2, F is out of order compared to Pcap1

    Create a packet capture by finding the earliest common packet by and
    then the latest common packet in both pcaps by ip.id. Then return
